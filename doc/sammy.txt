I think the absence of those benefits because it doesn't come into existence is not bad it's not bad but it's not deprived where is your existing child will be deprived of this benefit you could have you could have given another point of confusion for me here is that you acknowledge a spectrum of experience ranging from the very very positive to the very very negative but when you take the zero point of non-existence you say that we should be indifferent between and the very very positive words we shouldn't be indifferent between 0 and the very very negative the very very negative is worse obviously and we should avoid it and we should choose 0 every time over the very very negative but we should be indifferent to zero over the very very positive but I'm not quite sure how that that would work in practice so imagine if we you know we're sliding down the ramp of hedonic experience we start at the very very positive and we start life gets it's worse and worse and worse and worse and worse until it gets truly neutral and maybe there's other forms of neutral Beyond the Lights going out but for at least one form of neutral is not having any discernible experience and then we could just keep on sliding and things get a little bit bad and a little bit worse and all of a sudden were in hell it seems to me that if you're going to preserve The Logical Integrity of that Spectrum you have to acknowledge that

today I'm speaking with David Benatar David is a professor of philosophy at the University of Cape Town in South Africa he's the author of a few books better never to have been the harm of coming into existence us and most recently the human predicament a candid guide to Life's biggest questions and he's a philosopher who many of you have wanted me to speak with I've been getting emails and tweets about him for quite some time he is perhaps the most prominent exponent of a philosophy called antinatalism and you'll hear much more about that in today's episode the question for David really is whether or not existences worth the trouble and answers that question with an emphatic no and this makes for an interesting conversation as you'll hear there are a couple of places where our intuitions diverge and I think you just have to pick which intuition you find most compelling there but we talked about many interesting things we talked about the asymmetry between the good and bad things in life

I think our misanthropic arguments and here of course I'm restricting the scope to Bringing human beings into existence although I think the parallel points might be able to be made about about other sentient beings the original arguments that are Advanced are the philanthropic ones and those radio concerned about the being that you'll bring into existence and my view is not only that it's always a harm for that being but that is also a very serious on and given the seriousness of that harm I think that it's it's always going to be wrong to create a new being more recently I've developed some misanthropic arguments and those have to do with the harm that the being you bring into existence will do to others and by others I mean other human beings but also other sentient beings on the planet so those are two broad kinds of argument and I although they ones philanthropic and the other is misanthropic I don't think that these two are incompatible with one another so just to revisit a few of those utterances
